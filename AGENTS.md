# AGENTS

This file covers the entire repository.

## Conventions
- Keep frontend code dependency-free; prefer vanilla JS and DOM APIs over new libraries.
- Match the existing two-space indentation and concise arrow functions used in `web/assets/js`.
- When updating configuration values, keep `web/assets/js/config.js`, `web/assets/js/config.template.js`, and `docker/entrypoint.sh` in sync.
- Prefer descriptive UI text and avoid abbreviations in labels or buttons.

## Testing and docs
- The project has no automated test suite; note any manual checks you perform.
- If you adjust developer setup or environment variables, update `README2.md` to reflect the change.
